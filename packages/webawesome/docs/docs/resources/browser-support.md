Web Awesome officially supports the latest two major versions of the most popular browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and Opera.

We regularly test and ensure our website works smoothly on these browser versions. If you're using an older version, we strongly recommend upgrading to enjoy the best experience.

## Screen Reader Support

We're committed to making our website accessible to everyone. We specifically test with these screen reader and browser combinations:

- NVDA with Chrome
- NVDA with Firefox
- VoiceOver with Safari

We strive to make all components accessible, but screen reader and browser combinations can sometimes behave unpredictably. We're committed to addressing accessibility issues as they arise and will do our best to ensure a good experience for all users.

## Legacy Browser Support

While we focus on modern browsers, we understand some users may be using older versions. For critical issues, we will provide fixes and/or workarounds for in older browsers at our discretion.
