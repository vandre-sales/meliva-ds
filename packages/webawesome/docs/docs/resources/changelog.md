Web Awesome follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <wa-badge variant="brand">Stable</wa-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <wa-badge variant="warning">Experimental</wa-badge> badge should not be used in production. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

### New Features {data-no-outline}

- Added `.wa-hover-rows` to native styles to opt-in to highlighting table rows on hover.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements {data-no-outline}

- Fixed a bug in `<wa-dropdown>` that prevented the menu from flipping/shifting to keep the menu in the viewport [discuss:1106]

## 3.0.0-beta.1

We're excited to share the first beta release of Web Awesome, which includes some breaking changes that make the library significantly more intuitive and consistent!

The list looks extensive, but that's because we've tried to be thorough in documenting every change. We expect most users will only encounter a few of these during their upgrade. The majority are simple attribute renames (like clearable becoming with-clear) and component simplifications that actually reduce the amount of code you need to write.

**If you're a Web Awesome alpha user, please read through these release notes carefully!**

Many of these changes and improvements were the direct result of feedback from users like you! These changes represent our commitment to getting the fundamentals right as we move from alpha into a more stable beta release.

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes {data-no-outline}

- `input` and `change` events on form controls like `<wa-input>` now are always set to `bubble` and `compose`.
- Greatly simplified how native styles work and removed redundant utilities
  - Removed `.wa-button`, `.wa-callout` classes

  - Clarified which utilities classes can be applied to which native elements
- Renamed the `classic` theme to `shoelace`
- Removed `:root` selector from all theme, color palette, and semantic color stylesheets except for the default theme and colors. All of these styles are now solely scoped to classes, such as `.wa-theme-awesome`, `.wa-palette-bright`, and `.wa-brand-orange`.
- Removed most custom properties from components that can otherwise be styled with `::part()` selectors and standard CSS properties.

- Dropped `violet` and `teal`, instead using `purple` and `cyan` (this is not just a renaming, the colors have been adjusted too).
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-switch>` that caused tooltips to work incorrectly when toggling the switch

### Design Tokens {data-no-outline}

- Added `--wa-color-[hue]` tokens with the "core" color of each scale, regardless of which tint it lives on.
  You can find them in the first column of each color palette.

  - You can now override the brand color of any theme with any of the 9 hues supported.
  - Rich previews

### Components {data-no-outline}

#### `<wa-radio>`

- Dropped the `base` part. It can now be styled by directly applying CSS to the element itself.

- Added the `tag` part (and associated exported parts) to `<wa-select>` to allow targeting the tag that shows when more than the max number of visible items have been selected

- Fixed a bug that prevented the description from being read by screen readers

- `label` attribute to override the generated label (useful for rich content)
- `defaultLabel` property
- Dropped `getTextLabel()` method (if you need dynamic labels, just set the `label` attribute dynamically)

#### `<wa-menu-item>`

- `label` attribute to override the generated label (useful for rich content)
- `defaultLabel` property
- Dropped `getTextLabel()` method (if you need dynamic labels, just set the `label` attribute dynamically)

- Fixed a bug where child elements did not have correct rounding when headers and footers were absent.
- Re-introduced `--border-color` so that the card itself can have a different border color than its inner borders.
- Fixed a bug that prevented slots from showing automatically without `with-` attributes

#### `<wa-tab>`

- Fixed a bug that caused `document.createElement('wa-tab')` to fail (which also meant it could not be used in VueJS and other frameworks)

### Docs {data-no-outline}

- Added an orientation example to the native radio docs
- Fixed a number of broken event listeners throughout the docs

## 3.0.0-alpha.10

- ðŸš¨ BREAKING: updated all components to use native events instead of `wa-` prefixed events. This will allow components to work more like native elements in your code, frameworks, third-party plugins, etc. To update your code, simply remove the prefix from your event listeners for the following events.
  - `wa-input` => `input`
  - `wa-change` => `change`
  - `wa-blur` => `blur` (this event will no longer bubble, use `focusout` for a bubbling version)
  - `wa-focus` => `focus` (this event will no longer bubble, use `focusin` for a bubbling version)
- Added `.wa-callout` utility class
- Added the `orientation` attribute to `<wa-radio-group>` to support vertical and horizontal radio items
- Added docs for visual tests
- Added docs on how to cherry-pick native styles
- Changed the behavior of the `variant` and `size` attributes so that nested components that support these attributes but do not have them set inherit the values set on their ancestors. Additionally:

  - Added `variant` attribute to `<wa-button-group>`
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-tab-group>` that prevented nested tab groups from working properly
- Fixed slot names for `show-password-icon` and `hide-password-icon` in `<wa-input>` to more intuitively represent their functions
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-textarea>` that caused empty controls to submit a value if the initial value was deleted a certain way
- Fixed a bug in `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` styles that prevented full-width controls from using 100% width when wrapped in a `<label>`
- Fixed a bug in `<select>` styles that caused the caret to block interactions and prevented the caret from rendering unless wrapped in a `<label>`
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-checkbox>` that caused hints to render inline with the label

## 3.0.0-alpha.9

- Added new themes:
  - Glossy
  - Matter
  - Premium
  - Playful
- Added docs on themes and palettes
- Separated colors and typography out from themes so they can be used independently
- Added test suite to ensure all color palettes provide the color contrast they are supposed to
- Added `.wa-invert` utility class to invert the current color scheme
- Added `:state(blank)` to `<wa-input>`, `<wa-textarea>`, and `<wa-select>` to style form inputs differently when empty.

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

- Simplified the internal structure and CSS properties of `<wa-card>`, removed `base` part.
- Added `appearance` to `<wa-callout>` and `<wa-tag>`

- Updated the `--wa-border-width-*` and `--wa-border-radius-*` scale for better DX
  - Changed the value of `--wa-border-width-scale` to `1` and updated calculations of size-based `--wa-border-width-*` tokens

  - Removed unused `--wa-border-radius-xs` token and `wa-border-radius-xs` utility class
